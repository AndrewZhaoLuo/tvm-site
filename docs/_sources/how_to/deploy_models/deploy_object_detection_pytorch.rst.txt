Compile PyTorch Object Detection Models
=======================================
This article is an introductory tutorial to deploy PyTorch object
detection models with Relay VM.

For us to begin with, PyTorch should be installed.
TorchVision is also required since we will be using it as our model zoo.

A quick solution is to install via pip

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install torch==1.7.0
    pip install torchvision==0.8.1

or please refer to official site
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

PyTorch versions should be backwards compatible but should be used
with the proper TorchVision version.

Currently, TVM supports PyTorch 1.7 and 1.4. Other versions may
be unstable.

Compile with Relay VM

best performance, due to the existence of large dense operator in
